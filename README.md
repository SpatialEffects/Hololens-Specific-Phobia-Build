# Hololens-Specific-Phobia-Build

This HoloLens 2 application consists of a Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) with a large spider and consists of five steps:

1) the spider is stationary on the table at 1m distance

2) the participant moves around the room and continues to look at the stationary spider

3) the spider walks to 50cm distance

4) the participant moves around and continues to look at the stationary spider

5) the spider walks from 50cm to the hand and stops on the participant’s hand

 

The application was developed in Unity 2019.4.10f1, using the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) version 2.4.0 by Microsoft. Position of User Interface (UI) elements was made configurable through grab gestures and placing the spider on the starting position was implemented using the “tap to place” gesture. 

 

The application was designed for a research project from the Expertise Unit Psychology, Technology & Society (PsyTS) of Thomas More University of Applied Sciences (www.e-mentalhealth.be) in Belgium. The application was built by Wout Standaert (https://spatialeffects.be/). Other collaborators for the development of the application were Nele De Witte (researcher in the expertise unit PsyTS), Tom Van Daele (head of the expertise unit PsyTS), and Fernando Tarnogol (PsyTech LLC), who built the PHOBOS AR iOS application (https://apps.apple.com/be/app/phobos-ar/id1281732065?l) that inspired this Hololens 2 implementation.

 

The results of this research project are currently submitted for publication.
